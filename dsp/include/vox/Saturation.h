/** Mastering saturation: adds harmonics that make a master feel denser and help bass translate
    to small speakers.

    - Curves (per channel, 4x oversampled so the new harmonics don't fold back as aliasing):
        tape  y = S tanh(x / S)                          smooth, odd harmonics
        tube  asymmetric tanh (bias 0.35), slope 1 at 0   warm, mostly 2nd harmonic
        clip  y = x / (1 + |x/S|^4)^(1/4)                firmer knee, brighter odd harmonics
      S (where the curve bends) starts 7.5 dB above full scale at Drive 0 and comes down 1 dB per dB
      of Drive, so quiet material always passes at unity gain and only the louder moments are
      shaped; the effect fades in over the first 3 dB of Drive, so leaving 0 never jumps. Level
      stays put as you add Drive. Calibrated on a mix peaking near 0 dBFS: Tape at +6 dB, Mix
      50 % adds harmonics around -35 dB (felt more than heard); +12 dB is clearly audible.
    - Only what the curve adds (harmonics and peak rounding) goes through the oversampling filters
      (and, for tube only, a 1 Hz high-pass that removes the DC its asymmetry creates); it is mixed
      back onto the dry signal, so the clean signal is never filtered and Mix is a true parallel blend.
    - Constant latency (kLatency) in every state; exact pass-through (delayed) when off, at Drive 0
      or Mix 0, with 20 ms cross-fades (after reset() it starts fully in the set state). Drive glides, so moves never zipper.
